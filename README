Pidgin plugin budicons
----------------------

This package provides a pidgin pluging that synchronizes your pidgin contacts
based on a remote export (JSON). The remote export is expected to provide the
names and icons to use for your buddies.

Before the plugin can be compile it's important to edit the file "config.h"and
to update the variable holding the location of the JSON file (CONF_URL_JSON).

    #define CONF_URL_JSON "https://localhost/staff.json"

To compile under Ubuntu/Debian do:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool libsoup2.4-dev libglib2.0-dev libjson-glib-dev pidgin-dev

To install the plugin in your home account (DO NOT do this as root):

    make install

To execute the plugin start pidgin and open the plugins dialog:

    Main Window > Tools > Plugins or Ctrl+U

Then enable the plugin named "Buddy Icons Download". Enjoy!
